# Project 1: A Simple Human-Robot Interface (HRI)

## Background
Human-Robot Interface (HRI) is widely used allowing humans to easily interact with robots (see an example of Roomba's HRI below). The fundamentals of an HRI include **displaying** a robot's status, and **executing** commands from human operators. In this project, we will build a rudimentary HRI using LED(s) and a tactile switch button.

## Requirements:

### 1 (15%) Circuit Design
- (10%) Wire up the Raspberry Pi Pico, LEDs and the button to deliver a functional circuit for the HRI.
- (3%) Make a debouncing circuit for the button.
- (2%) Use a **common cathode** RGB LED.
> [!TIP]
> - Search online if any concepts are confused.
> - Scavenge in robotics lab or ask Dr. Zhang's help if any parts are needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Redeem the credits by uploading images and display them in [Documentation](#circuit-design) below.

### 2 (65%) Coding
- Program the Raspberry Pi Pico to: 
    - Encode robot's status into colors (`RED`, `GREEN`, `BLUE`) using LEDs .
    - Switch robot's behavior between `WORK MODE` and `PAUSE MODE` using a button.

- Tasks:
1. Initialization (System Check): blink all the LEDs at the same time if the button's GPIO pin is receiving correct default signal (`0` for `PULL_DOWN`, `1` for `PULL_UP`).
   - (4%) Blink all LEDs with frequency of 5 Hz, lasting 2 seconds.
   - (1%) The robot enters `PAUSE MODE` after this step.
2. When `PAUSE MODE` is activated:
   - (10%) `GREEN` LED fades in and fades out at frequency of 1 Hz (equally allocate fade-in and fade-out time).
   - (10%) Press the button to **immediately** switch to the `WORK MODE`.
3. When `WORK MODE` is activated:
   - (4%) `GREEN` LED stays constantly on.
   - (6%) Press the button to **immediately** switch to the **PAUSE MODE**.
4. Time `WORK MODE`.
   - (15%) If the accumulated `WORK MODE` time exceeds 45 seconds, substitute `GREEN` LED with **`BLUE`** LED in both modes (low-battery simulation).
   - (5%) If accumulated `WORK MODE` time over 55 seconds, blink `RED` LED (`BLUE` LED keep working) at frequency of 10 Hz.
5. (10%) Termination. **Despite the mode**, trigger a [hard reset](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/wipy/tutorial/reset.html#reset-and-boot-modes) if:
   - `RED` LED blinked 5 seconds
   - button is **pressed and held** for 3 seconds. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Mode switching is NOT a one-time function.
> - After 55 seconds of `WORK`, the `BLUE` LED and the `RED` LED are suppose to be functional together in both modes.

> [!TIP]
> - Break tasks down into small pieces (the smaller the better). You may need write a handful of unit test scripts.
> - `print()` function and Python Shell are handy tools.
> - [global variables](https://realpython.com/python-use-global-variable-in-function/) are useful for interrup handling functions.

### 3 (20%) Documentation
**It is important to get an engineering project well documented.** 
Complete the [Documentation](#documentation-student-work-) section below. 
1. Illustrate circuit design
   - (7%) Upload a circuit sketch (breadboard is optional) to this repository  and display it in the [Circuit Diagram](#circuit-diagram) section.
   - (7%) Upload a picture to this repository to illustrate your physical setup. Display it in the [Wiring Picture](#wiring-picture) section.
2. (4%) Briefly explain how your debouncing circuit works using **math** language.   
3. (2%) Briefly (within 80 words) propose a nice-to-have feature for this HRI with consideration of **safety**.
   State why this feature will the robot safer to the hardware/user/public/environment/etc..
